This custom Ford Bronco isn’t just another off-road build; it’s a statement of power, precision, and passion. Modified to perfection by Autobot Offroad, this rig sets a new benchmark for what a true off-road beast should be. And behind the wheel? None other than Lyn Macanas, a woman redefining what it means to be a car enthusiast in a world often dominated by men.</p><br/><strong>Lyn Macanas: The Lady of Iron</strong><br/><br/><p>Lyn Macanas is more than just an Autobot Offroad ambassador—she’s a force to be reckoned with. A powerhouse in the construction industry, she has built a reputation for strength, resilience, and vision. But beyond her business empire, Lyn has another passion that knows no limits: cars. Her collection is a mix of raw power and refined engineering, ranging from American muscle to high-performance off-road machines.</p>",

With Lyn Macanas behind the wheel and Autobot Offroad behind the build, this Bronco isn’t just made to ride—it’s made to lead. Whether on the road, off the beaten path, or taking center stage at an auto show, Project Yankee is a true masterpiece of off-road engineering.</p>",

The set up comes with a head turner front bumper and a 12,000 pounds synthetic rope winch. There’s a smooth 30-inch Light bar that just fits perfectly with the bumper. The light is an 8-beamer pattern adjustable using GPS depending on your speed. To match the body, we put on a neat and simple hood scoop with the satin black finish accent. Size is just proportion to its full body – not bulky. The skid plate is repainted in black (originally silver) but wait, there must be more for Camsur.</p>",

To ensure both beauty and performance, we also had to upgrade the breaking power using a 6-colliper with 355mm rotor disc Big Break Kit. For its exhaust system, we decided to install a catback single side exit not to worry about removing the spare tire.</p> <p>You will be hopping in using an automatic step board that could extend to up to 5 inches down. Inside your rig, you get access to your lights switch and a throttle controller to eliminate delays and increase acceleration. We installed a reclinable flat side seat so you can get inside the driver’s seat with no difficulty.</p> <p>Project Camsur would overcome the night using the LED bar lights roof mounted in a bracket that is nice and sturdy. Behind the raptor is a simple roll bar with a mesh installed with 3 pieces rail guard to avoid scratches and dents and your ultimate towing C-clamp partner.</p> <p>This truck is a sweet representation of sophistication and ingenuity.

Driven by this vivid imagination, we took the creativity of this ride’s owner as an inspiration and let his personality flow throughout his truck.</p><p>No doubt that driving in the metro can be very taxing. Most of the time, it is up to us to get creative and amuse ourselves amidst the chaos.
