        "description": "<p>Back in 2013, Mercedes unveiled the G63 AMG 6x6. Since then, many have tried to replicate the original six-wheeled G’s presence by jacking up the ride height of their SUV or truck and whacking another axle underneath. None of those creations have been able to conjure up the excitement we felt when we first saw the bonkers G63... until now. You see, this is a custom-built Suzuki Jimny 6x6. Although actually, the new rear wheels are just for show so it’s technically a Jimny 6x4. Still extremely cool.</p>",

        "description": "<p>When Ford launched the first Ranger Raptor pick-up a few years ago, we loved everything about it. Well, almost everything. The one component that didn’t seem to fit with the Baja-bashing nature was the 210bhp 2.0-litre diesel engine. Sure, it had 369lb ft of torque and we were never expecting an F-150 Raptor-syle V8, but it lacked soul and drama.  Luckily it seems Ford Performance was listening, because the new Raptor (based on the next generation Ranger unveiled late last year) will have a twin-turbo 3.0-litre EcoBoost V6 at its heart. Hurrah!</p>",
